I actually decided to scrap my originally idea that I've written about in the proposal discussion post to something else for this visual argument project. 
With election day and the deadline to register quickly approaching, I thought it would be an appropriate time to create a PSA, calling young people to act on their ideals and vote in order to make the difference they want. 
With this political cartoon that I've drew (I'm by no means an artist nor have any artisitic abilities ahahah but I thought it would be fun to try something new), I hope to inspire more people my age to go out and vote! 
10/19/2020 is the last day to register before the 11/03/2020 election.
